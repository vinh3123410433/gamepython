# Balloon Tower Defense 5 Clone (2011, Ninja Kiwi)

In the game, players attempt to prevent balloons (referred to as "bloons" in-game) from reaching the end of a set course by placing towers or road items along it that can pop the bloons in a variety of ways, typically by utilizing the power of monkeys. Some towers can stall the bloons and give the other towers more time to pop them by freezing and gluing the bloons. Money is gained by popping bloons, completing levels, and collecting bananas from existing banana farms which can be spent on new towers, upgrades for existing ones, or temporary items such as exploding pineapples and road spikes.

One of my favourite web browser games growing up, easy to play, contains multiple rounds of balloons (increasingly difficult) that reward cash after it's popped by a tower projectile (Dozens of towers i.e. pure damage to balloons, slow effect, area of effect damage).
